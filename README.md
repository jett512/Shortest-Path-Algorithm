# Shortest-Path-Algorithm In pr5.cpp, implements Dijkstra, BellmanFord, and Prim shortest path algorithms for weighed edges using adjacency lists and  provided ECL graph format. This format being the data structure created in ECLgraph.h These algorithms are then provided with driver EGR files to test the algorithms with.
